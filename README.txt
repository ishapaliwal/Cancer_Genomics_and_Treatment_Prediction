**PROJECT DESCRIPTION**
This project involves the analysis of cancer genomics data, focusing on biospecimen and clinical information. It includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and machine learning models to predict specific outcomes.

**PREREQUISITES**
To run this project, ensure the following:
1. Python: Python 3.6 or later should be installed.
2. Jupyter Notebook/Lab: Install Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab for running Jupyter notebooks.
3. Python Libraries: Ensure you have the following libraries installed:
	A. pandas
	B. numpy
	C. matplotlib
	D. seaborn
	E. sklearn
Use the following command to install the libraries if needed:
	pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn sklearn

**FOLDER STRUCTURE**
The project has the following folder structure:
1. Datasets: Contains the biospecimen and clinical data files used in this project.
2. Notebooks: Contains the primary Jupyter notebook for this project.
3. Results: Stores results and outputs from the data analysis and machine learning models.

**RUNNING THE PROJECT**
To run the project, follow these steps:
1. Open the Notebook:
	A. Navigate to the Notebooks folder.
	B. Open the Jupyter notebook: Cancer Genomics Project - Isha Paliwal and Harshini Naidu Ganpathy.ipynb.

2. Run the Notebook:
	A. Execute the notebook cells in sequential order.
	B. This process includes data loading, preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and machine learning model implementation.
	C. Review the results and visualizations produced by the notebook.

3. View Results:
	A. After running the notebook, the output files and visualizations will be saved in the Results folder.
	B. Check this folder for cleaned data, confusion matrices, and other results.

**NOTES**
Data Sources: Ensure that the data files in the Datasets folder are correct and updated if necessary.

**TROUBLESHOOTING**
If you encounter issues while running the project:
1. Missing Libraries: Double-check that all required Python libraries are installed. Reinstall if needed.
2. Notebook Errors: Review the error messages for clues. Ensure all data files are in the correct locations.

**CONCLUSION**
This README.txt file provides instructions on how to run the project and what to expect. By following these steps, you should be able to execute the project successfully and obtain meaningful results. If you have any additional questions or issues, consult the project team or relevant resources for support.
